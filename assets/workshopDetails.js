Hence IET On Campus, BIT Mesra brings to you a four day CERTIFIED Linux and Networking workshop, which is guaranteed to give you a good strong grasp on the technology, along with the potent networking applications of it. Further, you'll also understand much about how a LAN or any network actually works, and even set up your own, and use virtual operating systems.",
