### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.
